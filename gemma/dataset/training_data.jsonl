Radhanath Sikdar (1813 – 1870)\r\n\r\nAn Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal.\r\n\r\nKnown as the first person to calculate the height of Peak XV (later named Mount Everest) in 1852, proving it to be the world’s tallest mountain (29,002 ft at that time).\r\n\r\nWorked with Sir George Everest and Andrew Waugh during the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India (GTSI).\r\n\r\nHis mathematical genius laid the foundation for accurate Himalayan cartography.\r\n\r\n📌 Legacy: Celebrated as the “unsung hero” who measured the highest peak of the world.\r\n\r\n2. Nain Singh Rawat (1830 – 1895)\r\n\r\nA legendary “Pundit Explorer” from Uttarakhand.\r\n\r\nFamous for his secret expeditions across Tibet, Central Asia, and the Himalayas, disguised as a trader.\r\n\r\nMapped the course of the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River, surveyed Lhasa (Tibet’s capital), and recorded trade routes and altitudes.\r\n\r\nWalked thousands of kilometers, counting his steps with a prayer wheel-like device to measure distance.\r\n\r\n📌 Recognition: Awarded the Patron’s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, London, for his unparalleled contribution.\r\n\r\n3. Kishen Singh Milamwal (1850 – 1921)\r\n\r\nCousin of Nain Singh Rawat, also trained as a Pundit Explorer.\r\n\r\nConducted surveys in Tibet, Xinjiang, and Western China.\r\n\r\nCollected valuable data on geography, rivers, trade routes, and even cultural aspects of Central Asia.\r\n\r\nHis notes remain crucial sources for historians and geographers studying the Himalayas and Tibet.\r\n\r\n📌 Contribution: Expanded the knowledge of areas then inaccessible to Europeans.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe saga of these Indian surveyors is a story of intellect, bravery, and endurance.
